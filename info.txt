Everyone are free to use assets from this map or even upgrade the map to playable state.
Please start this project on Github! I put a lot of work to remake the map as close as possible to the original game.
Feel free to fork this repo, and if you decide to finish the project please push changes to original repo - you are still allowed to publish the map with your gameplay as your own, but please consider sharing change to original repo here:
